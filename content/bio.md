about: |
  I'm a problem solver: I enjoy tackling complex challenges and wrestling with them until I find a solution. I'm exploring different areas of tech to understand where my skills can have the greatest impact. I love continuous learning, experimenting with new technologies, and taking initiative in the projects I work on.
  
  Outside the office, I'm passionate about cooking and music.
